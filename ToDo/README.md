# Design #
1. Create a structure of a website and update it in the README at ```../Design/``` location.
<br>
You should try to think of the website as a sequence of pages (for example the first page should be the login page/register page, then maybe a sequence of pages to vote for each post and at the end verifying the voted candidates and then, submit).

# Website #
1. Initialize a basic React web application by executing this ```npx create-react-app VotingApp``` command at ```../WebApp/``` location.
<br>
This is the easiest task, hurry up and create a PR.

2. Once there is something in the **Design** group, implement it here.
<br>
As of now, assume that there are 5 posts and each post have 3 candidates. We will worry about making this dynamic later.

# Blockchain (Fabric) Network #
1. Create a FAbric network with 1 Org, 1 peer, 1 channel, Raft mechanism at ```../Network/``` location.

# README #
1. Update, beautify, correct grammatical mistakes in all the README files.
