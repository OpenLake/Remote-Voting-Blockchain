# Prismic Rich (💰) Text, for React
### A simple utility to render Rich Text with Prismic API V2

Prismic provides content writers with a WYSIWYG editor. It's awesome for formatting text but harder to deal with on client side. Fortunately, Prismic React provides utilities to tackle this exact issue!

Based on [prismic-richtext](https://github.com/prismicio/prismic-richtext), it allows you to render Prismic generated Rich Text as React components. It's meant to work in pair with the prismic-javascript library, a new javascript kit for the prismic API v2 [available here](https://github.com/prismicio/prismic-javascript).

* The [source code](https://github.com/prismicio/prismic-reactjs) is on Github.
* The [Changelog](https://github.com/prismicio/prismic-reactjs/releases) is on Github's releases tab.
* The [API reference](https://prismicio.github.io/prismic-javascript/globals.html) is on Github.


## Installation

#### Prismic Api Endpoint
First and foremost, make sure you're using the V2 API.
Your `prismic-configuration.js` (or equivalent) should probably contain a line like this one (or equivalent) 👇

```javascript
apiEndpoint: your-repo-name.prismic.io/api/v2
```

Consider polyfilling:
- [Object.assign()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/assign)
- [Object spread](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-proposal-object-rest-spread)

#### NPM
👇 Prismic React is on npm...
```sh
npm install prismic-reactjs --save
```

#### CDN
... and on CDN!
```
https://unpkg.com/prismic-reactjs
```

(You may need to adapt the version number)

#### Downloadable version

You'll find downloadable versions on our release page: [https://github.com/prismicio/prismic-reactjs/releases](https://github.com/prismicio/prismic-reactjs/releases).

The kit is universal, it can be used:

* Server-side with NodeJS
* Client-side as part of your build with Browserify, Parcel, webpack...
* Client-side with a simple script tag

# Usage

Although this package is mainly about RichText, Prismic React exposes 3 utilities.
Import them in your project this way:


``` javascript
import {Date, Link, RichText} from 'prismic-reactjs';
```

## Date utility

Like `Link`, `Date` is directly imported from [prismic-helpers](https://github.com/prismicio/prismic-helpers). It converts a Date string received from the API, to an ISO (8601) Javascript Date (ie. something you're used to work with):
```javascript
import { Date as ParseDate } from 'prismic-reactjs'
ParseDate(mydoc.data.mydate)
```
⚠️ Make sure you rename the import to not override the built-in Date type.
In a near future, we might rename it at package level.

## Link utility

`Link` generates links to documents within your website (and outside).
Give it a Link fragment and you'll get a full fledged url:
```javascript
Link.url(mydoc.data.mylink, ctx.linkResolver)
```
👆Note that `linkResolver` argument is not required if you are 100% sure that your're not linking to a document !

## RichText Component

RichText is a simple React component used to _render_ a Rich Text.
If you've been used to work with `RichText.render`, you're pretty much good to go!

#### Basic example

This is the most basic way to make it work, where `myDoc.data.title` is (obviously) a Rich Text object.
`linkResolver` will be triggered everytime RichText meets a link and wants to correctly resolve it.
```javascript
  import { RichText } from 'prismic-reactjs';

  // Use linkResolver if you *actually* have links
  const linkResolver = (doc) => {
    switch (doc.type) {
        case ('homepage'): return '/'
    }
  }

  const Header = (myDoc) => (
    <header>
        <RichText
            render={myDoc.data.title}
            linkResolver={linkResolver}
        />
    </header>
  );
  export default Header;
```

#### As text

Occasionally, you may require to render not a component, but a simple string.
Use RichText's static property `asText` to do so:
```javascript
  const Title = (myDoc) => (
    <h1>
        {RichText.asText(myDoc.data.title)}
    </h1>
  )
```

#### Creating a custom Link
Under the hood, [prismic-richtext](https://github.com/prismicio/prismic-richtext) takes your rich text data and _serializes_ it. Based on your data type (ie. heading, paragraph, list, link...), it creates an HTML template and renders it as a React component. Most of the time, it's enough: a list will always be a list. But if you work with React, you'll probably want to render Prismic links as React router dom `Link` instead of `<a>` tags. We created a property called `serializeHyperlink`, just for that:

```javascript
const myCustomLink = (type, element, content, children, index) => (
  <Link key={element.data.id} to={linkResolver(element.data)}>
    <a>{content}</a>
  </Link>
);
  const MyComponent = (myDoc) => (
    <div>
        <RichText
            render={myDoc.data.textWithLinks}
            serializeHyperlink={myCustomLink}
        />
    </div>
```

#### Passing your own serializer
If `serializeHyperlink` is not enough, you can alternatively pass an `htmlSerializer` function.
Full example and all accessible elements can be found [here](https://prismic.io/docs/javascript/beyond-the-api/html-serializer). If you need examples or help on this, feel free to open an issue!


#### Wrapping your rich text in a React component
Out of the box, RichText wraps your content in a `React.fragment`. But you can pass an optional Component property to RichText component. Re-writing our first example, we could simply pass `header` to Component:
```javascript
  const Header = (myDoc) => <RichText render={myDoc.data.title} Component="header" />
```

## Deprecation
In earlier versions of Prismic React, rich text rendering was deferred to a method called `render`.
This method is still accessible, although it doesn't seem to offer any advantage over a React component. If you disagree, please let me know!

#### example use

```javascript

import { RichText } from 'prismic-reactjs';

const Header = (myDoc) => (
    <header>
        {RichText.render(myDoc.data.title)}
    </header>
);
```
👆 Please note that this method is now a static property of `RichText` component.


## Install the kit locally

Source files are in the `src/` directory. You only need [Node.js and npm](http://www.joyent.com/blog/installing-node-and-npm/) to work on the codebase.

```
npm install
npm run dev
```
